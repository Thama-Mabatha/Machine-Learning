# Machine-Learning
Machine learning project built during a hackathon to predict lead conversion using classification models (CatBoost, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble methods). Includes feature engineering, handling categorical data, model evaluation (PR-AUC, log loss), and experimentation with blending models.
